## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
To run the broadcasting chat server, you need to have the following prerequisites:
Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your machine (version X or later).

### Running the Server
Clone this repository to your local machine or download the source code as a ZIP file.
Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the root directory of the project.
Compile the server source code using the following command:

sh
Copy code
javac Server.java
Run the server using the following command:

sh
Copy code
java Server
The server will start and listen for client connections on a specified port (default is 12345).

### Connecting Clients

Open a new terminal or command prompt for each client you want to simulate.
Navigate to the root directory of the project.
Compile the client source code using the following command:

sh
Copy code
javac Client.java
Run the client using the following command:

sh
Copy code
java Client
The client will prompt you to enter a username.

Once you've entered a username, you can start sending and receiving messages through the server.


## Usage
The server supports multiple clients simultaneously. Each message sent by a client will be broadcasted to all other connected clients.
Clients can disconnect by entering a predefined command (e.g., "/quit").
